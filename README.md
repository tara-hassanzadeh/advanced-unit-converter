# 🔁 Advanced Unit Converter (Length, Weight, Temperature)

A Python-based command-line unit converter that supports **length**, **weight**, and **temperature** conversions.  
Conversions are performed through **SI units** (meter, kilogram, Celsius) as a standard base for accurate and consistent results.

## 🚀 What’s New Compared to the Basic Version?

In the basic version, all values were converted **directly to SI units**.  
In this advanced version, units are converted **from any supported unit to another**, using **SI units as the internal reference** (e.g. mile → meter → cm).

**New features include:**

- ✅ Support for multiple unit types (length, weight, temperature)
- ✅ SI-based intermediate conversion logic
- ✅ Modular and scalable function design
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Interactive CLI (command-line interface)
- ✅ Easy to expand with more units or categories
